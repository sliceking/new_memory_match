# Memory Match - Version 0.5 (v0.5)

### Overview

> Version 1.0 continues where version 0.5 stopped by adding in the statistics of the memory match game. When a user clicks on a card the application will start tracking how many matches versus how many attempts. In combination with the stats there is also a tracker for how many times the game is played. Games played is tracked by resetting / restarting the game.

### Scope

>- Adding Stats
    - Declare a global variable, `matches`, and set it to 0
        - Every time the application finds a match this variable should be incremented by 1
    - Declare a global variable, `attempts`, and set it to 0
        - Every time a user attempts a match (clicks the 2nd card) the attempts should be incremented by 1
    - Declare a global variable, `accuracy`, and set it to 0
        - Accuracy is defined as a percentage of matches / attempts
    - Declare a global variable, `games_played` and set it to 0
        - When the page is loaded a new global variable should be defined called games_played. When the game is reset by clicking the reset button the games_played should be incremented by 1.
    - Declare a function, `display_stats`, that has the following functionality
        - Inserts the **games_played** value into the element that would be selected like this “.games-played .value”
        - Insert **attempts** value into the element that would be selected using this selector “.attempts .value”
        - Formats **accuracy** to be a percentage number with the **%** sign
        - Takes formatted **accuracy** and inserts the value of the variable into the element that has the selector of “.accuracy .value”
    - Declare a function, `reset_stats`, that has the following functionality
        - Resets variable **accuracy** to 0
        - Resets variable **matches** to 0
        - Resets variable **attempts** to 0
        - Calls **display_stats** function
    - On **Reset button** click, the function handler for the click event should have the following functionality
        - increment games_played by 1
        - call reset_stats
        - call display_stats
        - Reset all cards to have the back face showing
